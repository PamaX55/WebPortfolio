      Driven by the like of creating/fixing things, i started doing game modding and learned what code is capable of create.
      After finding a starting point in IT and building software for work and my own projects, i've made this little site. <br><br>
      Now i'm looking forward to grow in software development, being able to work in import projects with a good performance,
      adopting new technologies as required and needed.<br>
      Also being a member capable of contributing to a strong structure in the team work flow,
      helping new members joining the team and make them have a smooth integration.
