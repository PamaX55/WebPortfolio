      Driven by the curiosity of creating and fixing things, I started doing game modding and learned what code is capable of creating.
      After finding a starting point in IT and building software for work and my own projects, I've made this little site. <br><br>
      Now I'm looking forward to growing in software development, being able to work on import projects with good performance,
      adopting new technologies as required and needed.<br>
      Also being a member capable of contributing to a strong structure in the team workflow,
      helping new members who are joining the team, and make them have a smooth integration.
